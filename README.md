# Tablet Weaver
A simple app to convert GTT tablet weaving patterns to Color Coded patterns described by Mark Cook: https://www.amazon.com/Dakota-Bandanas-Color-Tablet-Weaving/dp/B07W68QKL6. I'm a beginner weaver, and have found it much easier to keep track of my turns and positioning with the color coded patterns. However, as a lot of fantastic patterns seems to be GTT patterns, I wanted an easy way to convert, using the colors of my own cards. 

Know something about tablet weaving and have a suggestion / request? Let me know!
